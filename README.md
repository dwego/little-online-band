# Express and Socket.io Online Band Project

## A fully functional project written in Node.js showing how to create a rapid client-server connection and acessable online rooms

This is a little project of a website which contains various instruments (at first only a piano) and allows users to create and join online rooms to play instruments together. It also has a text chat for communication between users.
At the frontend, HTML, CSS and Vannila JavaScript is being used, without any framework or preprocessor. while, at the backend, we are using Node.js, Express, Socket.io and MongoDB.
